A premise serves as the foundation of an argument. It can be a verified fact, an assumption, or the conclusion of a previous argument.\\n- **Conclusion**: The statement that is drawn or deduced from the premises. It is the main claim that the argument seeks to prove.\\n- **Inference**: The process of drawing a conclusion from premises. The strength of an argument is judged by how well this inference process supports the conclusion.\\n\\n#### Example Structure: Syllogism\\nThe most classic formal argument structure is the syllogism, which consists of two premises (major and minor) and one conclusion.\\n- **Major Premise**: All humans are mortal. (General statement)\\n- **Minor Premise**: Socrates is a human. (Specific statement)\\n- **Conclusion**: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Logical conclusion)\"\n",
