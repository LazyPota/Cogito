## 3.1 Ad Hominem (Personal Attack)
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_AD_HOMINEM; Personal Attack, Argumentum ad Hominem.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Relevance.

### Definition
- An attempt to refute or discredit an argument by attacking the character, motive, affiliation, or other personal attributes of the person making the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.[17, 21]

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- This fallacy occurs because a person's character, circumstances, or motives are logically irrelevant to the truth or falsehood of the claim they are making. An argument should be evaluated based on the strength of its premises and the validity of its reasoning (Logos), not on who is presenting it (Ethos).[2, 13] Attacking someone's credibility does not automatically invalidate the logic of their argument.

### Sub-Types
- **Abusive Ad Hominem:** A direct insult or disparagement of the opponent's character. Example: "You are an idiot, so everything you say must be wrong.".[19, 24]
- **Circumstantial Ad Hominem:** Attacking the opponent's circumstances, implying they have a vested interest in the argument. Example: "Of course you support the construction of that factory; you stand to profit from it.".[16, 19]
- **Tu Quoque ("You Too"):** Rejecting an argument by accusing the opponent of hypocrisy or of not being consistent with the argument they are presenting. Example: "My father advised me not to smoke, but he himself is a heavy smoker.".[21]

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:** "How can we trust his financial advice? He once went bankrupt."
- **Indonesian Context:** "You talk about the importance of honesty because you've never been number one in class!".[25, 26] Or, in a political context: "We don't need to listen to his criticism of government policy; he's from the opposition party.".[16, 27]

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** Phrases that focus on the speaker's identity, background, or motives ("People like you...", "It's no wonder you'd say that...", "Look at who he is...").
- **Counter-Strategies:**
    - **Identify and Separate:** Calmly point out that the focus of the argument has shifted. "I've noticed our discussion has started to shift from the topic to my character.".[28]
    - **Ignore and Redirect:** "My character or circumstances are not relevant to the validity of this argument. Let's get back to discussing the evidence regarding [debate topic].".[18, 20]

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "The point you're making touches on your opponent's character. In a strong debate, arguments are judged by their logic, not by who says them. How can we rephrase this point to focus on the substance of the argument?"
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of Ad Hominem should penalize the logicScore as it is a fundamental violation of debate logic. It can also reduce the sentimentScoreBonus if the language is abusive.

## 3.2 Strawman
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_STRAWMAN; Strawman Argument.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Ambiguity.

### Definition
- Occurs when a person misrepresents, simplifies, or exaggerates their opponent's argument to make it seem weaker or more extreme, and then attacks this distorted version instead of the actual argument.[17, 14]

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- This fallacy avoids honest debate. By creating a "strawman" (an easier version of the argument to attack), the perpetrator gives the illusion of having refuted the opponent's position, when in fact they have only defeated a caricature they created themselves.[17, 19] This is a violation of the principle of charity, which requires us to interpret an opponent's argument in its strongest possible form.

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:**
    - A: "I think we need to increase the budget for public education."
    - B: "So you want to cut the defense budget and leave our country vulnerable to attack?".[19]
- **Indonesian Context:**
    - A: "In my opinion, excessive infrastructure development can harm the environment."
    - B: "Oh, so you're anti-government and don't want our country to progress?".[27, 29]

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** Phrases like "So, basically you're saying that...", "In other words, you want...", or a summary of your argument that sounds inaccurate and exaggerated.
- **Counter-Strategies:**
    - **Clarify Firmly:** "That is not my position." or "I think you have misunderstood my argument.".[20]
    - **Restate Original Position:** "Allow me to clarify what I actually meant. My main point is...".[19]
    - **Point Out the Difference:** "The argument you're attacking is that [strawman version], whereas my actual argument is [original position]. The two are very different."

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "This is a strong rebuttal. However, it seems you are refuting a slightly different version of the argument than the one the AI presented. Could we try to respond directly to the main point the AI made?"
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of a Strawman should reduce the logicScore as it demonstrates a failure to engage with the opponent's argument honestly and accurately.

## 3.3 Hasty Generalization
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_HASTY_GEN; Overgeneralization.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Weak Presumption.

### Definition
- Drawing a general conclusion about an entire group based on a sample that is too small, unrepresentative, or biased.[17, 14] It is a form of flawed inductive reasoning.

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- A strong inductive conclusion requires sufficient and representative evidence. Hasty Generalization violates this principle by making a leap from a few specific examples (insufficient evidence) to a universal claim.[13] The strength of an inductive argument lies in the quality and quantity of its sample.

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:** "I met two people from city A, and they were both unfriendly. That means all people from city A are arrogant.".[17]
- **Indonesian Context:** "I've dated three guys, and all three were jerks. Ah, all men are the same!".[23, 29]

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** Use of absolute words like "all," "always," "never," "everyone" based on anecdotal or limited evidence.
- **Counter-Strategies:**
    - **Question the Sample Size:** "Are the few examples you mentioned enough to draw a conclusion about the entire group?".[18]
    - **Provide a Counterexample:** "I know several people from that group who are not as you described. Perhaps your conclusion is too broad.".[30]
    - **Request More Comprehensive Data:** "Is there any broader data or study that supports this generalization, beyond personal experience?".[18]

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "You're drawing a strong conclusion from a few examples. In logic, this is called a generalization. To be more convincing, such an argument often requires more data. Is there any other evidence we could add?"
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of Hasty Generalization should lower the logicScore as it shows a weakness in evidence gathering and interpretation.

## 3.4 Slippery Slope
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_SLIPPERY.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Weak Presumption.

### Definition
- Assuming that a relatively small initial action will inevitably trigger a chain of events, ultimately leading to a very negative or extreme outcome, without providing sufficient evidence for each step in the chain.[17, 21]

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- This fallacy exploits fear (Pathos) by presenting a worst-case scenario as an inevitable outcome. The error lies in the assumption that the cause-and-effect relationship between each step in the chain is strong and certain, when often the relationship is merely possible or even baseless.[19, 13]

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:** "If we allow students to bring phones to school, they will use them to cheat. If they cheat, they won't learn. If they don't learn, they will fail their exams, not graduate, and end up unemployed.".[17, 19]
- **Indonesian Context:** "If we let one person get a free drink, soon everyone will demand one, and our business will go bankrupt.".[25]

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** An argument that predicts a bleak future with a structure of "If A, then B; If B, then C;... then Z."
- **Counter-Strategies:**
    - **Focus on the First Step:** "Let's evaluate the impact of the first action (A) itself, not a series of hypothetical consequences that are not certain to happen.".[20]
    - **Question the Causal Links:** "Can you provide evidence that A will definitely lead to B? Are there no other factors that could stop this chain of events?"
    - **Show its Absurdity:** If the logical chain is particularly weak, show that the extreme conclusion is unreasonable.

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "You're outlining a series of potential consequences. This is a powerful way to show risk. However, to make this argument stronger, we need to ensure each link in the cause-and-effect chain is supported by evidence. Let's focus on the connection between the first and second steps."
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of a Slippery Slope reduces the logicScore because it relies on speculation rather than strong causal evidence.

## 3.5 Circular Reasoning
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_CIRCULAR; Begging the Question.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Unfounded Presumption.

### Definition
- Occurs when an argument uses its own conclusion as one of its premises. The argument essentially states that something is true because it is true, without providing external evidence.[17, 29]

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- This fallacy fails to provide any real proof. It merely restates the claim in different words, so no new information or reason is presented to support the conclusion.[17, 26] A valid argument must be based on premises that provide independent support for the conclusion.

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:** "This product is the bestseller because we sell more of it than any other product.".[15]
- **Indonesian Context:** "That rule must be obeyed because it is an obligation." This argument just goes in a circle without explaining why it is an obligation.[26]

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** An argument that feels circular, where the reason given is essentially a rephrasing of the initial claim.
- **Counter-Strategies:** Point out that no new evidence has been provided. "You are essentially saying that X is true because X is true. Can you provide any external evidence to support this claim?" [21]

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "Your argument seems to be using its conclusion as its reason. This is called circular reasoning. To strengthen it, try providing external evidence that can support your initial claim."
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of Circular Reasoning should severely reduce the logicScore as it is a fundamental error in the structure of proof.

## 3.6 False Dilemma
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_FALSE_DILEMMA; False Dichotomy.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Unfounded Presumption.

### Definition
- Presenting a situation as if there are only two possible options, when in fact there are other alternatives available. The options presented are often extremes.[17, 14]

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- This fallacy falsely limits the spectrum of available choices, forcing the audience to choose between two extremes and ignoring the possibility of a middle ground, compromise, or other alternative solutions.[17, 24] It is a misleading form of oversimplification.

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:** "If you don't support my decision, it means you were never really my friend.".[14]
- **Indonesian Context:** In a debate, someone says, "You must agree with me, or you are my enemy." [17] or "The choice is only between being a capitalist or a communist." [24]

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** Use of phrases that present a "black or white" choice, such as "either... or...", "there are only two options," or "if it's not A, it must be B."
- **Counter-Strategies:** Point out the existence of a third or more options. "Actually, there are other options between those two extremes. Let's consider option C." [22] or "Why must we limit ourselves to just those two choices? There are several other alternatives we haven't discussed."

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "You're presenting this situation as if there are only two choices. This can be very persuasive, but sometimes other options are overlooked. Is there a possible middle ground or another alternative we could explore?"
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of a False Dilemma should reduce the logicScore as it is an inaccurate simplification of an issue.

## 3.7 Red Herring
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_RED_HERRING.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Relevance.

### Definition
- An attempt to divert attention from the main argument by introducing a new, irrelevant topic that is often more interesting or emotional.[17, 31]

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- This fallacy evades the obligation to respond to the argument at hand. By throwing out an enticing "bait," the perpetrator hopes the opponent and audience will focus on the new topic, leaving the original argument forgotten and unrefuted.[31, 14] It is a clear violation of relevance.

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:** Journalist: "What is your response to the corruption allegations in your department?" Politician: "I am very concerned about those allegations, but what is more urgent right now is how we help the victims of the recent natural disaster."
- **Indonesian Context:** A: "We don't need to talk about lower taxes." B: "Let's talk about how bad the healthcare situation is in this country." [17]

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** A sudden shift in topic to a seemingly unrelated issue, especially if the new issue is more controversial or emotionally charged.
- **Counter-Strategies:** Acknowledge the new point briefly, then firmly steer the discussion back on track. "That's an interesting point, but it seems to be taking us away from the main topic. Let's get back to discussing [original topic]." [32, 19]

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "The point you're making is very interesting. However, it seems to be a slight shift from the main topic we were discussing. What if we return to the initial argument first?"
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of a Red Herring should reduce the logicScore as it is a conscious attempt to evade a relevant argument.

## 3.8 Appeal to Authority
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_APPEAL_AUTH; Argumentum ad Verecundiam.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Weak Presumption.

### Definition
- Relying on the opinion or testimony of an authority figure as evidence, when that figure's expertise is not relevant to the topic at hand, or when there is disagreement among experts in that field.[17, 14]

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- Citing an expert can be part of a strong argument, but it becomes fallacious when the cited authority is not qualified in the relevant field or their opinion is presented as absolute proof.[21] The truth of a claim is not determined by who says it, but by the evidence and reasoning that support it.

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:** "I read on a fitness blog that coffee is unhealthy, so we should stop drinking it." (A fitness blog is not a credible medical authority).[14]
- **Indonesian Context:** "According to my uncle, who is a lawyer, investing in tech stocks is very risky." (A lawyer's expertise is in law, not financial analysis).

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** Use of phrases like "According to [figure's name]..." or "An expert says..." without accompanying supporting data.
- **Counter-Strategies:** Question the relevance of the figure's expertise. "Is this figure's expertise relevant to the topic we are currently discussing?" [8] or "Although they are an expert in their field, is there other evidence or data to support this claim beyond their opinion?"

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "Citing an expert can make an argument very strong. Let's make sure the expertise of the figure you're quoting is truly relevant to this topic. Is there any other supporting data we could add?"
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of an irrelevant Appeal to Authority should reduce the logicScore because the evidence presented is weak.

## 3.9 Bandwagon
### ID & Alias
- FALLACY_BANDWAGON; Argumentum ad Populum, Appeal to Popularity.

### Functional Category
- Fallacy of Relevance.

### Definition
- Arguing that a claim is true or an action is good simply because it is popular or many people believe or do it.[33, 21]

### Reasoning Analysis (Why It's Fallacious)
- The popularity of an idea has no logical bearing on its truth.[23] History has shown many popular beliefs to be false (e.g., the belief that the Earth was flat). This argument shifts the focus from substantive evidence to social pressure or trends.

### Concrete Examples
- **General Context:** "Of course it's okay to wait until the last minute to do the assignment. Everybody else does it!" [14]
- **Indonesian Context:** "Many people are choosing candidate A, so A must be the right choice." [27] or "All my friends have the latest model phone, so I should have one too."

### Detection & Response in Debate
- **Warning Signs:** Arguments based on phrases like "everyone knows...", "many people believe...", "it's trending...", or "the majority thinks...".
- **Counter-Strategies:** Point out that popularity is not proof of truth. "The popularity of an idea doesn't automatically make it true. Let's examine the actual evidence and facts." [5] or "Is there any other reason to support this claim besides the fact that many people do it?"

### Recommendations for AI Feedback
- **Educative Feedback Phrase:** "You're pointing out that this idea is very popular. That's an important observation. However, in logic, the truth of an argument isn't always determined by its number of supporters. Let's try to find other evidence that could strengthen this claim."
- **logicScore Criteria:** The use of the Bandwagon fallacy should reduce the logicScore because its premise (popularity) is logically irrelevant to the conclusion (truth).
